            <p>Three years ago, i never imagined how much someone could mean to me until you came into my life. 
               every day with you has been a blessing, a journey full of laughter, growth, support, and love. we've faced ups and downs, but through it all, 
               we've stayed strong  side by side, hand in hand.
           </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for always being there for me, for loving me at my best and my worst, and for making life so much more beautiful just by being in it.
              i’m proud of everything we’ve built together, and i’m excited for everything that’s still to come.
            </p>
